            <p>
                    Our children are raised with the presence of computers. You definitely would not want your kids to only use computers without knowing the mechanisms behind them. “Programming” is a means to communicate with computers. By learning programming, kids could develop the ability of logical thinking and sense of creativity, and not fear making mistakes. In hope of helping kids develop programming skills from the age of primary school, we created a game-style storybook with tons of entertaining tasks, which are designed to guide kids to understand questions, analyze problems, and find solutions on their own. Through our devotion, we believe kids could benefit from our story book through development of “logical thinking” and “problem solving”.

            <h2 class="pt-5 pb-2">Why using AR?</h2>
            <p>
                    AR can not only enhance the joy of learning, but also let kids to understand the meaning of “automation”. 
                    In addition, with helps of props and control panels in combination with the picture book, kids can imagine the operation of computers, learn the concepts of programming easily. The reason why programming is mighty is, human only need to execute the step of solving, and the rest could be done by machines; programming is created to communicate with machines. 
                    When kids could execute programs they created via smartphone/tablet AR, they can have deeper experience of the power of program automation.

            <p>
                Hello, we are a team of enthusiasts for coding education. We believe everyone should know a little about coding. We are developing an AR story book that teaches kids how to code!

            <h2 class="pt-5 pb-2">Why kids need to know about coding?</h2>
            <p>
                Coding improves skills of problem solving, logical thinking and sense of creativity

            <h2 class="pt-5 pb-2">Our Motives</h2> 
            <p>
                With coding lessons and educational robots / developing sandboxes around the market, kids still lacks motivation as to why they should code, or what to code. In particular, most kids are not interested in coding tasks such as "print out numbers 1 to 10", which makes coding education for kids unappealing. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="pt-5 pb-2">Our objectives</h2>
            <h3 class="h5">1. Trigger kids’ motivation in coding through stories</h3>
            <p>
                Kids might not be interested in practical problems, but they surely love games and stories! "Playful Albert" is composed of amusing characters, meaningful stories, and exquisite illustrations. We hope kids would resonate to the story and help the characters through obstacles with coding.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h5">2. Teach kids to code in a fun / easy way</h3>
            <p>
                We also designed an easy-to-learn, easy-to-use coding system. Through the coding system, kids can start “coding” and not intimidated by learning program instructions. Any kids over 5 could start coding within 5 minutes and make our character “Albert” move! Furthermore, with our AR APP, Albert will “hop” onto the book and interact with the code, making the coding experience even more fun! 
            </p>

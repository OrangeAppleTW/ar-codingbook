        <h1 class="pt-4 pb-2">The era of information is coming, children should learn programming</h1>

        <p>Our children are born and raised in an environment of information and learn how to use computers; just like
            us,
            you definitely do not want your kids can only use computers without knowing the elements behind those
            computers.
            “Programming” is a language used for communicate with computers; in the process of learning how to
            programming,
            kids could develop the ability of logical thinking and creativity, without fearing to make mistakes during
            trial
            and error. We hope that kids could start developing the thinking of programming from the age of primary
            school,
            so we devote to create a game-storybook, and design many amusing tasks, which are able to instruct kids to
            understand questions, analyze problems, and try to find a solution on their own. In the process of this
            studying, kids could develop the ability of “logical thinking” and “problem solving”. </p>

        <h2 class="pt-4 pb-2">A programming storybook designed for kids, “Albert Isn’t Home”</h2>
        <p>This set of picture book features a robot named Albert. One day when albert was helping his mom by taking out
            the
            trash, he picked up an alien ship by accident, thus started his thrilling space journey… In the story,
            Albert
            visits lots of planets on his ship, facing many figures and challenges; kids have to follow the programming
            codes in the book, along with panel board or AR APP to help Albert to complete his tasks. </p>

        <h2 class="pt-4 pb-2">What can kids learn from the book?</h2>
        <p>There are many tasks in the picture book, kids have to operate the alien ship through command blocks, leading
            Albert to complete his tasks. </p>

        <p>When kids are organizing the command blocks, they can the basic concepts or programming such as
            “Serialization”,
            “Loop”, “Conditional judgment”, “data” automatically. </p>

        <h2 class="pt-4 pb-2">When combining AR?</h2>
        <p>AR not only provide the joy of learning, more importantly is to let the kids to understand the meaning of
            “automation”. </p>

        <p>Besides, props and panel boards can gear with the picture book, helping kids to imagine the operation of
            computers, learning the concepts of programming without using electronic devices. The reason why programming
            is
            mighty is, human only need to execute the step of solving, and the rest could be done by machines;
            programming
            is created to communicate with machines. </p>
        <p>When kids could execute the programs they create via smartphone/tablet AR, they can deeper experience the
            power
            of program automation. </p>

            <p>
                Hello, we are a team of enthusiasts for coding education. We believe everyone should know a little about coding. We are developing an AR story book that teaches kids how to code!

            <h2 class="pt-5 pb-2">Our vision</h2> 
            <p>
                The true value of programming is skills of problem solving and sense of creativity it brought about. However, with coding lessons and educational robots / developing sandboxes around the market, kids still lacks motivation as to why they should code, or what to code.  In particular, most kids might not be interested in solving problems like “how to make a better accountant program” or “how to connect people with same interests more efficiently through mobile app”, which makes coding education for kids even more difficult.

            <h2 class="pt-5 pb-2">Our objectives</h2>
            <h3 class="h5">1. Trigger kids’ motivation in coding education through story</h3>
            <p>
                Kids might not be interested in practical problems, but they surely love games and stories! That’s why we are developing a storybook composed of amusing characters, meaningful stories, and exquisite illustrations. We hope kids would resonate to the story world and make connection to the characters, bring the motivations like “save the forest” or “find the way home” to kids. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="h5">2. Teach kids to code in a fun / easy way</h3>
            <p>
                We also designed an easy-to-learn, easy-to-use coding system based on the famous “Turing Machine”. Through the coding system, kids can start “coding” and be free from being intimidated by learning program instructions. Any kids over 5 could get start in coding within 5 minutes and make our character “Albert” moving! Furthermore, with our APP, Albert will “hop” onto the book and interact with the code, making the coding experience even more fun!
